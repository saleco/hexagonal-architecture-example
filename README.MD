# Hexagonal Architecture Spring Boot Example
In this tutorial, we're going to create a practical example of the Hexagonal Architecture Java pattern.

We will be creating a simple application to receive an API request, deal with the business rules, persist the data on an in-memory database, and then finally send a response back to the API.

### Installing the project for the first time

```mvn clean install```

#### Starting local server by command line
 ```java -jar hexagonal-architecture-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```
